# Predictive Healthcare

A machine learning project for predicting and diagnosing health conditions based on patient medical data.

## Overview

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict various diseases. It implements data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model to provide accurate health predictions.

## Features

- Multi-disease prediction 
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Multiple ML algorithms
- Model evaluation with train-test-split and cross-validation

## Technologies

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning algorithms

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kuldeep2026/Predictive-Healthcare.git
cd Predictive-Healthcare
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
